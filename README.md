# Developers Guide to HIPAA Compliance
=================================

Version 1.0

## About

This guide is designed to provide developers with a solid understanding of HIPAA guidelines and their implications for application development. 

HIPAA was originally written in 1996, well in advance of the consumer Internet and a decade ahead of the first iPhone. Therefore, many of the rules and provisions deal with security and privacy issues from a world that didn't have a notion of apps, smartphones, and wearables. And while it's been amended to address privacy and security for the web, the complexity and wide-sweeping nature of the law makes teasing out the exact details to ensure compliance a bit cumbersome. 

Further, unlike PCI, there is no certification entity that can provide developers a rubber stamp of compliance approval. It's up to developers and companies alike to ensure compliance requirements are implemented properly. 

This guide will give you enough information to give you a strong understanding of HIPAA without getting bogged down in the legalese. We've tried to keep it straight forward, written in plain language.
