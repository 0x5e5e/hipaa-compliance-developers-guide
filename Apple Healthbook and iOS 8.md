# Apple Healthbook and iOS 8

Apple is reportedly set to announce iOS 8 as part of their World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC). One of the expected software elements of iOS 8 is [Healthbook](https://www.truevault.com/blog/eight-things-we-are-looking-for-from-apples-healthbook-and-ios-8.html#.U4bjnmRdXUc), a centralized location of health management information such as sleep records, emergency contact information, hydration and more.

It's unclear what will actually make it into the software, but one thing is certain, if Healthbook does launch there will be a race by application developers to integrate with it for the improved usability and visibility for Apple iPhone users.

Healthbook, from early reports, appears to be similar to Passbook, an application that lets users manage things like airline boarding passes, concert tickets, and more via the app. Select apps and partners, such as United Airlines and Eventbrite, are able to push their application data into Passbook for use there. 

It's likely that a similar implementation will be used for health apps such as RunKeeper to connect with Healthbook.

We'll update this page with particulars around iOS 8 and Healthbook as the news unfolds from WWDC.
